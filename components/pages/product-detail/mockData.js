  longDescription: `The Peace Lily, also known as Spathiphyllum, is a popular indoor plant that is native to tropical regions of the Americas and Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family and is known for its striking white flowers that resemble a calla lily. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are oval in shape and can grow up to 40-140cm in height.

The Peace Lily is a low-maintenance plant that is easy to care for, making it a popular choice for both novice and experienced gardeners. It thrives in low to medium light conditions and prefers moist soil, but can tolerate periods of drought. The plant is also known for its air-purifying properties, as it can remove harmful toxins such as benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene from the air.

In addition to its aesthetic and health benefits, the Peace Lily is also a symbol of peace and tranquility. It is often given as a gift to express these sentiments.`,
